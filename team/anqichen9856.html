<p>This Project Portfolio documents my contributions to MooLah, a student project for a Software
Engineering module. Tasked to work in teams of five, to develop seedu project AddressBook - Level 3
to a product of our own . Our team decided to morph it to an expense tracker - MooLah.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Expense tracking is an inherently troublesome task, because it includes managing
multiple budgets and monitoring complicated statistics. MooLah aims to streamline this process by
providing a user-friendly desktop Command-Line Interface (CLI) solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It improves user experience through autocomplete and prefix suggestions, boosting efficiency.
It also an external library Natty, to parse natural language time parser, to allow accept
more intuitive input format for time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Budgeting feature, track expenses under different budgets, clearly view the budget progress bar and
get timely notification when thresholds are reached. Support managing, editing, deleting budgets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Statistics feature view in different modes, be it a pie chart, a table or a trendline.
Reminders of future events .

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My main role in the team was to develop the budget feature. The following is a summary of my
contributions to this feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to track expenses under budgets, and manage different budgets</strong>.
The budget feature is a significant enhancement to MooLah. Users need a tool to help them monitor their expenditure and avoid overspending.
This is especially relevant to our main target users - university students, most of whom do not have a stable income and live on resources from
parents. The budgeting feature enables users to be more controlled with their own expenses, grow healthy saving habits,
and cultivate good financial management skills to prepare for the future.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does:
(i) Allows the user to add, modify, delete, and clear budgets (ii) Allows users to switch primary budget
(iii) Allows users to view expenses in a past budgeting period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:
Developed many budget-related commands, and write unit tests for all (lines coverage = 100%)
The major difficulty is normalize
had to deep copy and constantly debug for marginal cases such as February, leap year, and months with 30 days
make sure it integrates well with undo redo
Since budgeting-related commands are many,
had to check through every command to make sure all undo and redo changes are immediately reflected on GUI
and json file
make sure a deep copy of budget is made upon every changes of the existing budgets in MooLah</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature allows users to add, edit, switch, delete, clear budgets as well as switch the budget window
to view expenses in a past period. It involves adjustments to the existing model, logic, UI components, and integrates
well with the current implementation of other core features such as undoredo and statistics.
** Credits: <em>{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used
in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}</em></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added two commands (EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand &amp; DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand) that allows
users to edit or delete expenses directly from the budget, without having to switch to general expense list first.</p>

reminders for future events&#8230;&#8203; many more wonderful things to explore.
Equipped with natural language time format parser, MooLah understands what you type, just like a friend - no more rigid
date and time formatting.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feel a need to cut your spending? Try MooLah&#8217;s awesome budgeting feature!
It can help you cultivate better financial management habits in the following ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each budget has a progress bar with a percentage (rounded to the nearest integer), which indicates how much you have
spent as a proportion to the limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The color of the progress bar implies the following 4 situations:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>GREEN: Less than half of the limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YELLOW: Spent half of the limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ORANGE: Reached 90% of the limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RED: Exceeded the limit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your expenses reach 50% of the limit, it will notify that you&#8217;re halfway through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your expenses reach 90% of the limit, it will give a warning to remind you of the approaching limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your expenses exceed the budget limit, it will give another warning to remind you to
cut down on your spending. However, the percentage will continue to update even you exceed the budget, to give you a
better idea of how much you have overspent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that when the budget is exceeded too much (more than 10^7 times the budget
limit), you will not be able to add any new expense&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I hope that won&#8217;t happen!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Want your expenses tracked under a recurring budget? Simple enough with this command: <code>addbudget</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concrete format is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>addbudget d/&lt;DESCRIPTION&gt; p/&lt;AMOUNT&gt; sd/&lt;START_DATE&gt; pr/&lt;PERIOD&gt;</pre>

<p>For example, given after typing</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>addbudget d/school p/300 sd/01-10-2019 pr/month</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll see that a new budget "school" is created, and set to $300, recurring monthly, starting from 1st October 2019.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tips:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All expenses that do not have a budget will go under "Default Budget", which is not deletable nor modifiable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each budget must have a unique name (case-insensitive).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 types of budget periods are supported, namely <code>day</code>, <code>week</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>year</code> (all in lower case).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The year in start date is optional, i.e. you can simply input <code>01-10</code> and the year will be automatically set
to the current year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The start date can be any time in the past or future, the budget period will automatically
normalize to the current period.
For example, if today is <code>23-10-2019</code>, when you type <code>sd/01-07 pr/month</code>, the resulting budget period
will be <code>01-10-2019 to 31-10-2019</code>, since that&#8217;s the period anchored by today&#8217;s date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All budgets are recurring. Continuing from the example above, at 1 Nov 2019, you&#8217;ll see the budget&#8217;s period refreshed
to <code>01-11-2019 to 30-11-2019</code>, and all past expenses archived, giving you an empty budget panel to start with.</p>

<p>Budgets form a partition of all expenses. That is, an expense must belong to <strong>one and only one</strong> budget,
and all expenses from all budgets must add up to the total number in the general expense list.
Each expense keeps track of its own budget through budget name (of Description type) - this is made possible by
disallowing duplicate names in UniqueBudgetList. On the other hand, each budget keeps track of a list of expenses
added to this budget.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure above, when user inputs "addbudget &#8230;&#8203;", LogicManager executes the string, MooLahParser creates the
corresponding CommandParser which parses the input into an AddBudgetCommand. AddBudgetCommand then validates itself by
checking if there is an identical budget already existing in MooLah. If no duplicate budgets are found, it executes the
command, adding the specified new budget to MooLah. After that, AddBudgetCommand creates a CommandResult and passes it
back to LogicManager. LogicManager then saves the updated MooLah as json file, and returns the CommandResult to GUI to
be displayed to user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of other commands has similar flow as AddBudgetCommand, differing only in the parameters and corresponding
methods in ModelManager, MooLah and UniqueBudgetList. A noteworthy implementation in EditBudgetCommand is that it
has a inner class EditBudgetDescriptor to record the updated attributes of the budget, which is then used in the method
EditBudgetCommand#createEditedBudget(Budget, EditBudgetDescriptor) to create an edited budget, maintaining non-updated
attributes the same as the original budget.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a budget is edited, the original budget&#8217;s expenses will be transferred to the updated budget through
Budget#transferExpensesTo(Budget other). The transfer process does two things: (i) set the expenses&#8217;s budget name
to the new budget name; (ii) add the expenses to the new budget&#8217;s expense list. Similarly, when a budget is deleted,
all its expenses will be transferred to default budget through the same method.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any time, there is one, and only one, <strong>primary budget</strong> in MooLah. All expenses added will go to this primary budget.
If the user wants to track expenses under a different budget,
he switches to the target budget first, before adding the expense.
A newly created budget is automatically set to primary.
MooLah creates a default budget upon first launching. If no budget is created by the user, expenses will be tracked
under this default budget, which has a huge budget limit (10^21) and budgeting period (100 years).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SwitchBudgetCommand takes in a budget name and switches primary budget to that budget.
Given below is an example usage scenario of SwitchBudgetCommand:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user launches MooLah for the first time. The default budget will be created and set as the primary budget.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> The user now wants to add another expense "movie", but does not want it tracked under "School". As such, the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A budget is like a <strong>sliding window</strong> that moves along the time axis. The window has a fixed size determined by the
BudgetPeriod, an enum class having five values: DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR, INFINITY (for Default Budget).
Only expenses within the current window are shown in the app. Every time
the budget refreshes, the window "slides" to the next period, starting with an empty screen that gradually gets
populated with newly added expenses over time. This is achieved through the BudgetWindow class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the class diagram of BudgetWindow:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/BudgetWindowClassDiagram.png" alt="BudgetWindowClassDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure above, BudgetWindow has 3 attributes: start date, end date, and period. The start and end
dates are modifiable, but the period is fixed. This corresponds to the above-mentioned "sliding window" concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A budget keeps a list of all expenses ever been tracked by this budget, including historical ones. Additionally,
it has a method Budget#getCurrentPeriodExpenses() that filters from this list expenses within the current
budgeting period, which are shown in the current GUI screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When users want to view expenses in a past period, they can do so by executing SwitchPeriodCommand. This command
takes in a timestamp and switches the budget window to a period anchored by that timestamp. This is achieved by
BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor) method. This method takes into account marginal cases such as months with 30
days, February, and leap year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario of SwitchPeriodCommand:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user has a monthly budget "school" that recurs on the 5th of each month. Suppose the current date is
Nov 10. As a result, the current budgeting period will be Nov 5 - Dec 4. There are 1 expense "chicken rice" recorded
in this current period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user wants to view expenses in September. As such, the user executes <code>switchperiod t/20-09</code>
(interchangeable with any other dates within Sep 5 - Oct 4). This command calls
<code>BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)</code>, which shifts the window&#8217;s start and end dates to Sep 5 and Oct 4 respectively, while maintaining the fixed period - MONTH.
As a result, the user sees expenses tracked under the budget during this period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor) method is also called upon adding a new budget to MooLah. No matter how
far the start date inputted by the user is from now, it will be normalized to the current period, such that expenses added
subsequently will correctly be reflected in the budget panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each budget, once added, will recur infinitely. This is achieved by Budget#refresh() along with the Timekeeper class.
Every 10 seconds, Timekeeper checks if it is a new day, and call Budget#refresh() if necessary. Subsequently,
BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor) is called; the anchor passed in is current time. As a result, the budget is
successfully normalized to the current period.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Addition of expenses are executed through AddExpenseCommand. Since it does not take in any INDEX parameters,
the execution can be done irrespective of the currently shown list, and the change will always be correctly reflected
in the budget panel.
The case is different for editing and deleting expenses, which takes in an INDEX dependent on the currently shown list.
As such, editing from the general expense list is different from editing from a budget&#8217;s expense list. This is why two
separate commands, EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand and DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand, are implemented, apart from
EditExpenseCommand and DeleteExpenseCommand which work on the general expense list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand and DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand obtain their target expense (to be edited/deleted)
through <code>model.getPrimaryBudget().getCurrentPeriodExpenses()</code> in the two commands' validate() and execute() method.
This makes sure the INDEX is based on the primary budget&#8217;s currently shown expense list, which includes all expenses
within the current budgeting period.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="list-budgets"><a class="link" href="#list-budgets">List budgets</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ListBudgetsCommand shows a list of all budgets stored in MooLah. The command returns a CommandResult with view
request to "BudgetListPanel.PANEL_NAME". Subsequently, MainWindow#changePanel(PanelName) will switch the currently
shown panel to BudgetListPanel.
ListBudgetsCommand has the same effect as "view budget list".</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ui-component-of-budget"><a class="link" href="#ui-component-of-budget">UI Component of Budget</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three classes related to the UI display of Budgets:
(i) BudgetCard, which shows the budget name, period, and progress bar - GUI representation of a budget
(ii) BudgetListPanel, which displays a list of BudgetCard - called through ListBudgetsCommand or "view budget list"
(iii) BudgetPanel, which displays a BudgetCard at top representing the primary budget, and a list of expenses tracked
under this primary budget in this current budgeting period - called through "view primary budget"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The progress bar in BudgetCard shows the proportion used against the budget limit. This is calculated by
Budget#calculateProportionUsed(), which divides the sum of all current period expenses against the budget limit,
returning a Percentage that wraps the result (rounded to the nearest integer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides, the budget also gives popup notification when proportion used reaches 50%, 90%, and 100%. These 3 status
correspond to Budget#isHalf(), Budget#isNear() and Budget#isExceeded(). Before each command in MooLah is executed, the
initial values of these 3 booleans are recorded by LogicManager#recordInitialPrimaryBudgetStatus(), which returns a
boolean array of size 3. At the end of each command, the final values of these 3 booleans are recorded again by
LogicManager#recordFinalPrimaryBudgetStatus(). The two resulting arrays are then passed into
MainWindow#showWarningIfAny() for a comparision, and if any values have changed, MainWindow#showPopupMessage will show
the corresponding pop up notification to remind the user of the budget progress.</p>

the same properties as the budget, except: (i) it flattens the BudgetWindow field into start date, end date and period,

<p>Budgeting-related commands integrate well with Undo-Redo feature, by extending UndoableCommand. Undoable commands are
those modifying data in MooLah, for example, AddBudgetCommand and EditBudgetCommand. On the other hand, commands that
only result in GUI changes, such as ListBudgetsCommand, is not undoable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A difficulty here is to make every "undo" immediately reflected on GUI. Since undo rollback on models, this dictates that
every change must result in a new budget object being created and replacing the old one. Otherwise, even though the
change is reflected backend, it will not show in frontend because the Budgets in two models are still referring to
the same object. This task is handled by Budget#deepCopy(), which is widely called from UniqueBudgetList, in every method
that modifies the existing budgets.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Solution (Current implementation):</strong>
Each Expense keeps a budgetName field which indicates the name of the Budget it is tracked under. Since UniqueBudgetList
checks for duplicate budget names, a name is sufficient to identify a Budget. Besides, since budgetName is of
Description type instead of Budget type, it is easy to convert to String, and resolves the problem of infinite loop
when creating json files. Also, the resulting JsonAdaptedExpense file will not be too long, since the "budgetName"
property stores only the budget name instead of the full budget object.</p>
