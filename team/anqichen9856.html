<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Project Portfolio documents my contributions to MooLah, a student project for a Software
Engineering module. In teams of five, we were tasked with developing the seedu project "AddressBook - Level 3"
to a product of our own choice. Our team decided to morph it to a hassle-free expense tracker - MooLah.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Expense tracking is an inherently troublesome task, because it includes managing
multiple budgets, monitoring complicated statistics, and anticipating future spending.
MooLah aims to streamline this process by providing a user-friendly desktop Command-Line Interface (CLI) solution. MooLah is written in Java, and has about 23 kLoC. It improves efficiency of expense tracking through autocomplete and prefix suggestions.
With a natural language time parser, MooLah accepts more intuitive and flexible time input. The robust budgeting feature
help users cultivate healthy spending habits. With powerful statistics, users can visualize their expenditure in
graphical forms. Besides, the menu feature is specially tailored to students in National University of Singapore,
allowing them to record an expense in school canteens directly from preset menus. Furthermore, MooLah&#8217;s support for undo-redo
creates a seamless user experience. All these solid and well-developed features make MooLah a perfect personal financial assistant.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of Contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My main role in the team was to develop the budgeting feature. The following is a summary of my
contributions to this feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to track expenses under different budgets, and manage multiple budgets</strong>.<br>
The budgeting feature is a significant enhancement to MooLah. Users need a tool to help them monitor their expenditure and avoid overspending.
This is especially relevant to our main target users - university students, most of whom do not have a stable income.
The budgeting feature enables users to be more controlled with their own expenses, grow healthy saving habits,
and cultivate good financial management skills to prepare for the future.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What It Does:
(i) Allows users to monitor spending through a budget progress bar and receive timely notifications when total expenditure hits
important thresholds.
(ii) Allows users to add, modify, delete, and clear budgets.
(iii) Allows users to switch primary budget.
(iv) Allows users to view expenses in a past budgeting period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights:
The budgeting feature involves adjustments to the existing model, logic, storage and UI components.
I developed ten budgeting-related commands, added utility classes such as <code>Percentage</code>, <code>BudgetPeriod</code> and <code>BudgetWindow</code>,
and wrote unit tests for all, achieving 100% lines coverage for my part.
One highlight is <code>BudgetWindow#normalize()</code>, which shifts the budgeting period to another anchored by a specific date.
While developing this method, it was necessary for me to take into account marginal cases such as February, leap year, and months with 30 days,
and constantly fix emerging bugs to ensure good functionality.
Besides, to make sure budgeting integrates well with undo-redo, I must check through every command to make sure all
undo-redo changes are immediately reflected both on GUI and in storage files. Considering that undo revolves
around <code>Model</code>, I need to ensure a deep copy of the budget is made upon every single modification of existing budgets in
the model, which was challenging and time-consuming to debug.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancement</strong>: added two commands (<code>EditExpenseFromBudgetCommand</code> &amp; <code>DeleteExpenseFromBudgetCommand</code>) that allow
users to <strong>edit or delete expenses directly from the budget panel, without having to switch to general expense list first</strong>.</p>

<p>Feel a need to cut your spending? Try MooLah&#8217;s awesome budgeting feature!
It can help you cultivate better financial management habits in the following ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each budget has a progress bar with a percentage (rounded to the nearest integer), which indicates how much you have
spent as a proportion to the limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The color of the progress bar implies the following 4 status:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GREEN</strong>: <code>0% - 49%</code> of the limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>YELLOW</strong>: <code>50% - 89%</code> of the limit (MooLah will notify you&#8217;re halfway through)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ORANGE</strong>: <code>90% - 100%</code> of the limit. (MooLah will remind you of the approaching limit)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RED</strong>: <code>&gt; 100%</code> of the limit. (MooLah will give a warning and advise you to cut down on your spending. However, the
percentage will continue to update even if you exceed the budget, to give you a better idea of how much you have overspent.)</p>

All expenses that do not have a budget will go under <code>Default Budget</code>, which is not deletable nor modifiable.<br>
Each budget must have a <strong>unique (case-insensitive) name</strong>.<br>
MooLah supports 4 types of budget period input: <code>day</code>, <code>week</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>year</code> (all in <strong>lower case</strong>).<br>
The year in &lt;START_DATE&gt; is optional, i.e. you can simply input <code>01-10</code> and the year will be automatically set
to the current year.<br>
The &lt;START_DATE&gt; can be any time in the past or future, the budget period will <strong>automatically
normalize to the current period</strong>.
For example, if today is <code>23-10-2019</code>, when you type <code>sd/01-07 pr/month</code>, the resulting budget period
will be <code>01-10-2019 to 31-10-2019</code>, since that&#8217;s the period anchored by today&#8217;s date.<br>
All budgets are <strong>recurring</strong>. Continuing from the example above, on 1 Nov 2019, you&#8217;ll see the budget&#8217;s period refreshed
to <code>01-11-2019 to 30-11-2019</code>, and all past expenses archived, giving you an empty budget panel to start with.

<p>Budgets form a <strong>partition</strong> of all expenses. That is, an <code>Expense</code> must belong to one and only one <code>Budget</code>,

Each <code>Expense</code> keeps track of its own <code>Budget</code> through the <code>budgetName</code> attribute&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this is possible because
<code>UniqueBudgetList</code> disallows duplicate budget names. On the other hand, each <code>Budget</code> keeps track of a list of <code>Expense</code>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure above, when user inputs "addbudget &#8230;&#8203;", <code>LogicManager</code> executes the <code>String</code>, and <code>MooLahParser</code>
creates the corresponding <code>CommandParser</code> which parses the input into an <code>AddBudgetCommand</code>. <code>AddBudgetCommand</code> then
validates itself by checking if there is an identical <code>Budget</code> already existing in <code>MooLah</code>. If no duplicate budgets are
found, it executes the command, adding the new <code>Budget</code> to <code>MooLah</code>. After that, <code>AddBudgetCommand</code> creates a <code>CommandResult</code>
and passes it back to <code>LogicManager</code>. <code>LogicManager</code> then saves the updated <code>MooLah</code> as Json file, and returns the
<code>CommandResult</code> to GUI to be displayed to user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of other commands follows a similar flow as <code>AddBudgetCommand</code>, differing only in the parameters and corresponding
methods in ModelManager. A noteworthy implementation in <code>EditBudgetCommand</code> is that it has a inner class <code>EditBudgetDescriptor</code>
to record the updated attributes of the budget, which is then used in the method <code>EditBudgetCommand#createEditedBudget(Budget, EditBudgetDescriptor)</code>
to create an edited <code>Budget</code>, maintaining non-updated attributes the same as the original <code>Budget</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a <code>Budget</code> is edited, the original budget&#8217;s expenses will be transferred to the updated budget through
<code>Budget#transferExpensesTo(Budget other)</code>. The transfer process does two things: (i) set the expenses&#8217;s <code>budgetName</code>
to the new budget&#8217;s name; (ii) add the expenses to the new budget&#8217;s expense list. Similarly, when a <code>Budget</code> is deleted,
all its expenses will be transferred to <code>Default Budget</code> through the same method.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any time, there is one, and only one, <strong>primary budget</strong> in MooLah. All expenses added will go to this primary budget.
If the user wants to track expenses under a different budget, he switches to the target budget first, before adding the expense.
A newly created budget is automatically set to primary.
MooLah creates a <code>Default Budget</code> upon first launching. If no budget is created by the user, expenses will be tracked
under this <code>Default Budget</code>, which has a huge budget limit (<code>10^21</code>) and budgeting period (<code>100 years</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>SwitchBudgetCommand</code> takes in a budget name and switches primary budget to that budget.

<h4 id="budgetwindow-and-switchperiodcommand"><a class="link" href="#budgetwindow-and-switchperiodcommand">BudgetWindow and SwitchPeriodCommand</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A budget is like a <strong>sliding window</strong> that moves along the time axis. The window has a fixed size determined by
<code>BudgetPeriod</code>, an enum class with five values: <code>DAY</code>, <code>WEEK</code>, <code>MONTH</code>, <code>YEAR</code>, <code>INFINITY</code> (for Default Budget).
Only expenses within the <strong>current window</strong> are shown in the app. Every time the budget refreshes, the window "slides"
to the next period, starting with an empty screen that gradually gets populated with newly added expenses over time.
This is achieved through the <code>BudgetWindow</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the class diagram of <code>BudgetWindow</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/BudgetWindowClassDiagram.png" alt="BudgetWindowClassDiagram" width="33%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure above, <code>BudgetWindow</code> has 3 attributes: start date, end date, and period. The start and end
dates are modifiable, but the period is fixed. This corresponds to the above-mentioned "sliding window" concept.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A budget keeps a list of all expenses ever been tracked by this budget, including historical ones. Additionally,
it has a method <code>Budget#getCurrentPeriodExpenses()</code> that filters from this list expenses within the current
budgeting period, which in turn get to be shown on MooLah&#8217;s GUI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When users want to view expenses in a past period, they can do so by executing <code>SwitchPeriodCommand</code>. This command
takes in a <code>Timestamp</code> and switches the budget window to a period anchored by that <code>Timestamp</code>. This is achieved by
<code>BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario of <code>SwitchPeriodCommand</code>:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user has a monthly budget "school" that recurs on the 5th of each month. Suppose the current date is
<code>10 Nov</code>. As a result, the current budgeting period will be <code>5 Nov - 4 Dec</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user wants to view expenses in September. As such, the user executes <code>switchperiod t/20-09</code>
(<code>20-09</code> is interchangeable with any other dates within <code>5 Sep - 4 Oct</code>). This command calls
<code>BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)</code>, which shifts the window&#8217;s start and end dates to <code>5 Sep</code> and <code>4 Oct</code> respectively,
while maintaining the fixed period&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<code>MONTH</code>. As a result, the user sees expenses tracked under the budget during <code>5 Sep - 4 Oct</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)</code> method is also called upon adding a new <code>Budget</code> to MooLah. No matter how
far the start date inputted by the user is from now, it will be normalized to the current period, such that expenses added
subsequently will correctly be reflected in the budget panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each budget, once added, will recur infinitely. This is achieved by <code>Budget#refresh()</code>, along the <code>Timekeeper</code> class.
Every 10 seconds, <code>Timekeeper</code> checks if it is a new day, and call <code>Budget#refresh()</code> if necessary. Subsequently,
<code>BudgetWindow#normalize(Timestamp anchor)</code> is called; the anchor passed in is current time. As a result, the <code>Budget</code> is
successfully normalized to the current period.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ui-component-of-budget"><a class="link" href="#ui-component-of-budget">UI Component of Budget</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three classes related to the UI display of budgets:
(i) <code>BudgetCard</code>, which shows the budget name, period, and progress bar&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;GUI representation of a <code>Budget</code>
(ii) <code>BudgetListPanel</code>, which displays a list of <code>BudgetCard</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;called through <code>ListBudgetsCommand</code> or <code>view budget list</code>
(iii) <code>BudgetPanel</code>, which displays a <code>BudgetCard</code> at the top, and a list of current period expenses below&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;called through <code>view primary budget</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The progress bar in <code>BudgetCard</code> shows the proportion used against the budget limit. This is calculated by
<code>Budget#calculateProportionUsed()</code>, which divides the <strong>sum of all current period expenses</strong> against the <strong>budget limit</strong>,
returning a <code>Percentage</code> that wraps the result (rounded to the nearest integer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides, the budget also gives popup notification when proportion used reaches <strong>50%</strong>, <strong>90%</strong>, and <strong>100%</strong>. These 3 status
correspond to <code>Budget#isHalf()</code>, <code>Budget#isNear()</code> and <code>Budget#isExceeded()</code>. Before each command in MooLah is executed, the
initial values of these 3 booleans are recorded by <code>LogicManager#recordInitialPrimaryBudgetStatus()</code>, which returns a
boolean array of size 3. At the end of each command, the final values of these 3 booleans are recorded again by
<code>LogicManager#recordFinalPrimaryBudgetStatus()</code>. The two arrays are then passed into <code>MainWindow#showWarningIfAny()</code>
for a comparision, and if any values have changed, <code>MainWindow#showPopupMessage()</code> will show the corresponding pop up
notification to remind the user of the budget progress.</p>

<h4 id="storage-of-budgets"><a class="link" href="#storage-of-budgets">Storage of Budgets</a></h4>

<p>Budget objects are stored in Json format, through the <code>JsonAdaptedBudget</code> class. The Json file has the same properties

(ii) it stores a list of <code>UniqueIdentifier</code> to expenses, instead of a list of <code>JsonAdaptedExpense</code>.</p>

<p>Budgeting-related commands integrate well with Undo-Redo feature, by extending <code>UndoableCommand</code>. Undoable commands are
those modifying data in MooLah, for example, <code>AddBudgetCommand</code> and <code>EditBudgetCommand</code>. On the other hand, commands that
only result in GUI changes, such as <code>ListBudgetsCommand</code>, is not undoable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A difficulty here is to make every "undo" immediately reflected on GUI. Since undo rollback on models, this dictates that
every change must result in a new budget object being created and replacing the old one. Otherwise, even though the
change is reflected backend, it will not show in frontend because the Budgets in two models are still referring to
the same object. This task is handled by <code>Budget#deepCopy()</code>, which is widely called from <code>UniqueBudgetList</code>, in every method
that modifies the existing budgets.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Solution (Current implementation):</strong>
Each <code>Expense</code> keeps a <code>budgetName</code> field which indicates the name of the <code>Budget</code> it is tracked under. Since <code>UniqueBudgetList</code>
disallows duplicate budget names, a name is sufficient to identify a <code>Budget</code>. Besides, since <code>budgetName</code> is of
<code>Description</code> type instead of <code>Budget</code> type, it is easy to convert to <code>String</code>, and resolves the problem of infinite loop
when creating Json files. Also, the resulting <code>JsonAdaptedExpense</code> file will not be too long, since the <code>budgetName</code> property
stores only the budget name instead of the full <code>Budget</code> object.</p>

<p><strong>Solution (Current implementation):</strong>
Adopt Alternative 1. Every Expense must be tracked under one and only one budget. If the expense is added before
adding any budgets, a default budget with a huge limit and infinite period is created for tracking all expenses without
a proper user-defined budget. This ensures that the main screen has a budget and shows a budget status bar at all times.
