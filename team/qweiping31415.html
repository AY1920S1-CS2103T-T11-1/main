<p>This portfolio aims to document the contributions my contributions to MooLah</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team of 4 Computer Science students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic Command
Line Interface desktop application AddressBook - Level 3 for our Software Engineering project.
Over 6 weeks, we chose to morph it into a finance tracker application called MooLah. This enhanced application
allows the typical NUS student to manage past expenses with the use of budgets, be reminded of
future and recurring expenses, with added convenience coming from user-friendly input formats, aliases
and helpful statistics. It is written in Java, and has about XXX kLoC(TO BE CONFIRMED).
My main developer responsibility in the team consists of the statistics features across every component.</p>

<p><strong>Big feature</strong>: I have added <strong>the ability to generate statistics</strong> in MooLah</p>

<p>What it does: This features consists of a basic summary of expenses, a side-to-side comparison
as well as a trend analysis across different periods of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the problem
of untracked expenditure is greatly solved by allowing users to monitor their spending habits,
with the added flexibility of choosing their visual representation as well as varying levels of depth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: As the feature is closely coupled to the budget component and requires to support other dependencies such as
undo/redo, constant coordination with other developers is required.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statistics feature is facilitated by the <code>Statistics</code> class, which is part of the <code>model</code> package.
Its main purpose is to allow users to have an alternative view for the entries in <code>MooLah</code>. The
main entries that <code>Statistics</code> interacts with are <code>Expense</code> and <code>Budget</code>, and the metrics chosen to be displayed
are handled mainly by <code>Statistics#calculateStatistics()</code>. The method recognises command words such as
<code>stats</code>, <code>statscompare</code> and <code>statstrend</code>, where each results in a different visual representation and represents
a different use case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final outcome of these interactions are reflected directly in <code>MainWindow</code>, as a popup whenever the command is received

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of the <code>stats</code> command word is to request <code>MooLah</code> to visualise the total expenditure across
expenses of different categories as a percentage of the total expenditure of all expenses tracked under the budget
where the command is called. The visual representation used here will be a PieChart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the <code>stats</code> command word is handled by <code>MooLah</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user enters the command <code>stats sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019</code> to visualise the total percentage of each category
as a percentage of total expenditure across all categories, in the primary budget.
The command is received by <code>AddressBookParser</code>, which then creates a <code>StatsCommandParser</code> object,
to subsequently help to parse the input by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. The newly created <code>StatsCommandParser</code> calls <code>parse("stats sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019")</code>,
which in turns calls <code>ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize("sd/01-10-2019 ed/01-11-2019", PREFIX_START_DATE, PREFIX_END_DATE)</code> to
split the arguments into its preamble(the start date and end date). This returns an <code>ArgumentMultimap</code> object, <code>argMultimap</code> containing the split input.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. The <code>StatsCommandParser</code> object calls <code>ParserUtil.parseTimestamp(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_START_DATE).get())</code> which parses the arguments to get the start date.
The date, that is present in this example, is parsed into the correct form and the end date is obtained similarly with
<code>ParserUtil.parseTimestamp(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_END_DATE).get())</code>.
A <code>StatsCommand</code> object containing the start date and end date is created and returned to the <code>LogicManager</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The LogicManager calls <code>StatsCommand.execute()</code>, which calls <code>Model#getFilteredExpenseList()</code> to retrieve the list of expenses stored in MooLah.
The correct <code>Statistics</code> object, <code>statistics</code>, will be created with <code>startStatistic</code> and the <code>calculateStats</code> method, will switch to the correct mode,
to produce the correct feedback to the user, as well as update the attributes in <code>statistics</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. Percentages, categories and the title description of the <code>Statistics</code> will be used to create the <code>CommandResult</code> object,
which is returned to the <code>LogicManager</code> and subsequently to the UI where a popup in the form of a pie chart will be generated.</p>

<p><strong>Solution (Current Implementation): </strong>
Adopts Alternative 2. It is important that every aspect of the user experience gets covered, and what <code>MooLah</code> before the
inclusion of <code>Statistics</code> is the appreciation of percentage expenditure in each category of expenses. Expenses can already be
observed in its chronological order using <code>ListExpense</code> while individual view of expenses under a category can be accessed
using <code>FindExpense</code>. Offering a visual view on expenditure under each category complements with the existing implementation
of sequential view in the primary budget.</p>

<p>For each of the command words, users will be given the option to choose a Visual Representation method they prefer
if the use case allows for it, instead of the default option we have prioritised.
Currently, statistics under <code>stats</code> mode can only be displayed in a pie chart,
and users may have different preferences for formats. The current implementation for MooLah
is such that only expenses up to the current date will be included and any expenses after the current date
is considered an event, which is not tracked by statistics. The inclusion of events in statistics
can be a possible complementary feature to a prediction feature to pre-empt users about their incoming expenses.
Last of all, more modes can be added to all existing commands, such as comparing with periods across different budgets
other than being restricted within the same budget</p>
