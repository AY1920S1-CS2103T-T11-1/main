== Introduction

MooLah is a hassle-free expense tracker for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expenses*.
More importantly, MooLah is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). MooLah supports user-friendly input format and
aliases that greatly improves the efficiency of CLI operations. It also supports recurring expenses and includes menus
from canteens of National University of Singapore for students to track their everyday food expenses in a second.
If you can type fast, MooLah can get your expense management tasks done much faster than traditional GUI expense
trackers.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user
  e.g. in `add p/PRICE`, `PRICE` is a parameter which can be used as `add p/2.50`
* Items in square brackets are optional
  e.g `d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE c/CATEGORY [t/DATE] can be used as 'add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food' or
'add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 c/Food t/25-01'

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Basic Expense/Event-Related Commands
==== Adding an expense/event: `add`

Add an expense/event to the expense tracker. If the timestamp denotes a future date, an event is added.
If not, an expense is added instead.

Upon launch, Moolah will remind the user of upcoming events (7 days or below), and also ask users whether they wish
to automatically add expenses corresponding to transpired events.

Format: `add d/DESCRIPTION p/PRICE c/CATEGORY [t/TIMESTAMP]`

[TIP]
* An expense must have exactly 1 category
* If a time is not specified, an expense will be added with its date being the current system date.

Examples:

* `add d/Brian birthday p/40 c/Gifts t/31-12`
* `add d/Buffet p/250 c/Food`

===== (Coming in v1.4) Using relative time/date input: `yesterday`

The user can specify an expense/event’s time using relative dates and times.

Example:
If the current date is 12 Sep 2013
Input: `add d/Chicken Rice p/2.50 t/Yesterday Noon`
Result: adds an expense of 2.50 at 11 Sep 2013, 12pm

* Only the description is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `chick` will not match `chicken`
* Expenses matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. an expense with description
`Chicken rice`, and expense with description `Duck Rice` will both match `rice`

=== Saving the data
Expense tracker data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

=== Viewing Statistics
==== Summary : `stats`
Produces statistics regarding the user’s expenses.

The statistics is in the form of a pie chart, where every piece represents the combined expenditure of all expenses
under the category, taken as a percentage of the total expenditure in the budget the command was called.

Format: `stats [sd/START_DATE] [ed/END_DATE]`

- Date formats accepted include `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD-MM`, where the year will be taken as the current year if it is
not specified.

- `START_DATE` will be checked to be earlier than `END_DATE`

- If `START_DATE` is specified but `END_DATE` is empty, statistics is calculated from one month after `START_DATE`

- If `START_DATE` is empty but `END_DATE` is specified, statistics is calculated from one month before `START_DATE`

- If both `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are empty, statistics is calculated from one month before the current date.

Example:
`stats`
`stats sd/12-12-2018`
`stats sd/11-11-2018 ed/12-12-2018`

==== Compare : `statscompare`
Produces and displays statistics regarding the user’s finance for 2 time periods.
The statistics include all categories of items, the number of entries and the total expenditure of all expenses under
the category.
The number under each cell represents the difference using `second period – first period`.

Format: `statscompare sd1/START_DATE_1 sd2/END_DATE pr/PERIOD`

- Date formats accepted include `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD-MM`, where the year will be taken as the current year if it is not
specified.

- `PERIOD` takes in either of the following keywords: week, month, year

NOTE[Work in progress]:
- day is ideally recognised as a keyword to `PERIOD`

- If day is given as a keyword under `PERIOD`, statistics will be calculated from 12:00am of the day till 11:59pm of
the same day

Examples:
`statscompare sd1/01-01-2019 sd2/01-02-2019 pr/month`
