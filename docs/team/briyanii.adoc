== PROJECT: MooLah

---

== Overview

This portfolio aims to document the contributions made to MooLah by Brian Fung.

MooLah is a desktop expense tracking application, which was morphed from the code of Software Engineering Education's AddressBook - Level 3 used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
MooLah is a hassle-free expense tracker aimed at NUS students.

The user interacts with it using a Command-Line Interface (CLI), and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 17 kLoC.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *shortcut feature*
** What it does:
1. allows the user to assign an alias to an input, allowing them to create shortcuts for command which they
frequently require. this saves them a lot of time entering all the arguments for a command, as well as reduces the need to
remember what exactly needs to be entered.
2. saves successfully inputted commands to history to allow reentering of commands used within the same session
3. generic commands
** Justification: as this is a CLI-Interface application, users would generally have to remember a lot of commands as
well as command syntax. This feature allows users to reduce the keystrokes needed to complete a task, and
reduce the need to remember commands.
** Highlights:


* *Major enhancement*: added *autocomplete and syntax highlighting
** What it does:
1. highlights syntax to show which arguments belong under which prefix in the CLI-interface.
2. adds placeholders to indicate what argument a prefix is expecting after a user enters the prefix
3. shows what are the valid commands the user can enter
4. shows what are the required prefixes and optional prefixes which the command requires.

** What it does: allows the user to see what arguments they may have missed, and help them remember what each the arguments needed
for each command
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user does not need to remember confusing commands and syntax.
Especially due to the fact that our application supports a large number of commands. This allows users to see what valid commands there are as well
as what arguments are required without having to press enter the command and see an error message.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands as well heavy use of javafx elements.
